# Frontend App (horizon-rent-ui) - Integration Tasks for Backend Login & Gmail Login

This document outlines the tasks required for the `horizon-rent-ui` frontend application to integrate with the `HorizonRent` backend's authentication mechanism, and to add Gmail login functionality.

## 1. Review `LoginView.java` - **COMPLETED**

*   Understood how `LoginView.java` handles user input and authentication requests.

## 2. Configure Authentication Endpoint - **COMPLETED**

*   `LoginView.java` has been configured to send authentication requests to the backend's new endpoint: `/vaadin-login`.

## 3. Handle Authentication Responses - **COMPLETED**

*   Implemented `HomeView.java` to handle successful authentication responses by fetching user details from the backend's `/api/user` endpoint and displaying a welcome message with the user's name and profile picture.
*   Implemented `MainLayout.java` to provide a consistent layout with a logout button.

## 4. Session Management - **PENDING (User Action Recommended)**

*   Understand how Vaadin manages user sessions and ensure it aligns with the backend's session management (e.g., using cookies, JWTs).

## 5. Deployment Configuration - **PENDING (User Action Recommended)**

*   Ensure the `horizon-rent-ui` project is configured for deployment in a way that allows it to communicate with the `HorizonRent` backend. This might involve setting up proxy configurations if running on different domains/ports during development.

## 6. Gmail Login Integration - **COMPLETED (Core Setup)**

*   **`LoginView.java`**: Added an "Login with Google" button that links to `/oauth2/authorization/google`.
*   **Post-Login Handling**: After a successful Google login, the user will be redirected to `/home` where `HomeView` will fetch and display user information.

## 7. Frontend Security - **COMPLETED**

*   Removed explicit Spring Security configuration from the frontend, relying solely on the backend for authentication and authorization.
*   Refactored `HomeView` to be more robust by moving the `RestTemplate` call to the `onAttach` method and making `RestTemplate` injectable.
*   Added `HomeViewTest` to verify the correct display of user information, following a TDD approach.
