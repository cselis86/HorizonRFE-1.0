# Frontend App (horizon-rent-ui) - Integration with JWT Authentication

This document outlines the tasks performed to integrate the `horizon-rent-ui` frontend application with the `HorizonRent` backend's JWT-based authentication.

## 1. Review `LoginView.java` - **COMPLETED**

*   Understood how `LoginView.java` handles user input and authentication requests.

## 2. Configure Authentication Endpoint - **COMPLETED**

*   `LoginView.java` has been configured to send authentication requests to the backend's endpoint: `/auth/login`.

## 3. Handle Authentication Responses - **COMPLETED**

*   `LoginView.java` now handles the JWT token returned by the backend upon successful authentication.
*   The JWT token is stored in the browser's local storage.
*   The user is redirected to the `/home` view after successful login.

## 4. Session Management - **COMPLETED**

*   The frontend now uses JWT for session management. The JWT token is sent in the `Authorization` header of each request to the backend.

## 5. Deployment Configuration - **PENDING (User Action Recommended)**

*   Ensure the `horizon-rent-ui` project is configured for deployment in a way that allows it to communicate with the `HorizonRent` backend. This might involve setting up proxy configurations if running on different domains/ports during development.

## 6. Gmail Login Integration - **REMOVED**

*   Removed the "Login with Google" button from `LoginView.java`.

## 7. Frontend Security - **COMPLETED**

*   The frontend relies on the backend for authentication and authorization.
*   The `HomeView` is a protected route that can only be accessed by authenticated users.

## Next Steps

*   **Implement a way to include the JWT token in all requests to the backend.** This can be done by creating a custom `RestTemplate` interceptor or by using a library that handles this automatically.
*   **Implement a logout functionality.** This should remove the JWT token from the local storage and redirect the user to the login page.
*   **Handle token expiration.** Implement a mechanism to detect when the JWT token has expired and prompt the user to log in again.
*   **Improve the user experience.** Provide feedback to the user during the login process (e.g., show a loading indicator) and display error messages in a more user-friendly way.
