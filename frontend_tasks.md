# Frontend App (horizon-rent-ui) - Integration Tasks for Backend Login & Gmail Login

This document outlines the tasks required for the `horizon-rent-ui` frontend application to integrate with the `HorizonRent` backend's authentication mechanism, and to add Gmail login functionality.

## 1. Review `LoginView.java` - **COMPLETED**

*   Understood how `LoginView.java` handles user input and authentication requests.

## 2. Configure Authentication Endpoint - **COMPLETED**

*   `LoginView.java` has been configured to send authentication requests to the backend's new endpoint: `/vaadin-login`.

## 3. Handle Authentication Responses - **PENDING (User Action Recommended)**

*   Implement logic in the Vaadin frontend to handle successful authentication responses (e.g., redirect to a dashboard, store authentication tokens).
*   Implement logic to handle authentication failures (e.g., display error messages to the user). (Basic error handling for `?error` parameter is already present).

## 4. Session Management - **PENDING (User Action Recommended)**

*   Understand how Vaadin manages user sessions and ensure it aligns with the backend's session management (e.g., using cookies, JWTs).

## 5. Deployment Configuration - **PENDING (User Action Recommended)**

*   Ensure the `horizon-rent-ui` project is configured for deployment in a way that allows it to communicate with the `HorizonRent` backend. This might involve setting up proxy configurations if running on different domains/ports during development.

## 6. Gmail Login Integration - **COMPLETED (Core Setup)**

*   **`LoginView.java`**: Added an "Login with Google" button that links to `/oauth2/authorization/google`.
*   **Post-Login Handling**: After a successful Google login, the user will be redirected. You'll need to implement logic in your Vaadin application to handle this redirect, potentially fetch user details from the backend, and display appropriate user information.
